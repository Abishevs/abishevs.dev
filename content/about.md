# Hej! I'm Eduards Abishevs

A passionate technology enthusiast from Sweden. I'm currently pursuing an Engineering degree in Mechatronics at Chalmers University of Technology, where my fascination with **mechanical engineering**, **systems engineering**, and **robotics** continues to grow.

## My Journey

My journey in tech began with an insatiable curiosity about how things work. This curiosity soon turned into a passion for programming, leading me to explore various languages and technologies. From developing web applications using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to diving into the depths of **Python** for backend development and automation, my love for coding has only deepened. Now that am also learning Rust!

## Why I Love What I Do

There's something incredibly rewarding about turning ideas into reality. Whether it's a line of code that solves a complex problem or the first successful run of a wifi car I've helped design and build, the joy of creating something functional and useful is unparalleled.

## Skills and Interests

- **Languages**: Python (OOP, file handling, servers), Golang, C++, Rust.
- **Web Development**: Experienced in creating sleek, responsive websites.
- **Linux Enthusiast**: Proficient in Ubuntu & Arch, dabbling in sysadmin tasks while managing VPS.
- **Robotics**: Eager to learn more and develop my skills in robotics and mechatronics.
- **Cloud Services**: Familiar with basic AWS services.
- **CAD & 3D Printing**: Skilled in Autodesk Inventor and CatiaV5 with practical experience in 3D printing.

## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not coding or tinkering with electronics, I like  to dive into a good book (often in Swedish, English sometimes Russian).

- My favorite book is Hail Mary by Andy Weir (Author of The Martian)
